# chatbot
A chabot named "ANSH" 

We have created this chatbot in Python using AIML interpreter name as PyAIML.
For GUI we have used TKinter which provides state of the art functions for building gui from scratch.
For database handling we have used the built in database provided by Python.
PyAIML interprets the AIML files and gives the output by matching patterns.
We have used file handling for AIML files to append new patterns and make bot handle new questions.
